## What does this do?
This is a bot for the Telegram messaging service, with the purpose of downloading and saving media from tweets to a local machine (thanks to [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl)). It is intended to be run within a containerised solution.

## Configuration
### Environment variables
The following environment variables are used by the bot, and should be passed into the container's environment when run:
#### Required:
  - `T_TOKEN` - The Telegram Bot API token to use. Should be a String, `"12345:AAAABBBBCCCCDDDD"`
  - `ALLOWED_IDS` - The Telegram user IDs to accept messages from. This is required, as without it, anyone who finds your bot username on Telegram will be able to send a link, and download media to your server. Should be a comma separated String of IDs, `"123456,654321"`

#### Optional:
  - `LOG_LEVEL` - The lowest level of logging to output, as a String. Can be one of the following: `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warn"`, `"error"`, or `"critical"`. Defaults to `"info"`

### Cookies
A valid Twitter cookie file allows gallery-dl to access the same tweets you can see. Without this, it will only be able to access what is publicly visible. A file named `twitter_cookies.txt` should be present in the top directory.

You can get cookies using this Chrome plugin
`https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm`

### Docker-compose
If you want to deploy the project by docker-compose
You should create the `etc` folder in the same directory as docker-compose
Then put `twitter_cookies.txt` and `gallery-dl.conf` in
### gallery-dl configuration
gallery-dl accepts a wide range of configuration options. An example `gallery-dl.conf` file is included, but this can be adjusted to your requirements (See [gallery-dl configuration](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl#configuration) for more).
